        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the App:</strong> To operate, maintain, and provide all features and functionalities of the App, including calculating your "Safe to Spend" amount, providing Smart Alerts, and showing your Cash Runway.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve and Personalize the App:</strong> To understand and analyze how you use the App and to develop new products, services, features, and functionality. We may use anonymized and aggregated data for this purpose.</li>

            <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share your information with your explicit consent.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We work with trusted third-party service providers (e.g., financial data aggregators, cloud hosting providers) who provide services on our behalf.

        We implement robust security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These include encryption, firewalls, and secure socket layer technology. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.
