        <h2 class="section-heading">The Problem with Traditional Budgeting</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>Budgeting often feels like a chore. It demands meticulous tracking, categorizing every expense, and constantly adjusting. For busy professionals, this is not just tedious, it's unsustainable. The traditional approach leads to frustration, guilt, and ultimately, giving up.</p>
            <p>Most finance apps exacerbate the problem. They're overloaded with features, charts, and complex interfaces that make you feel overwhelmed, not empowered. Instead of simplifying your financial life, they add another layer of complexity, turning money management into a second job.</p>
